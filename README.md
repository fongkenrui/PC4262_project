# PC4262_project
Semester project for PC4262 Remote Sensing

To set up, clone this repo and run `setup_env.bat` (for windows users).
This installs and sets up `nbdime` and `nbstripout` for jupyter notebook version control.
Run `setup_env.bat` again whenever new packages are added to `environment.yml`.
